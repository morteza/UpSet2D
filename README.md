# UpSet2D

*UpSet2D* is a Python package to visualize hypergraphs as two dimensional matrices, inspired by PAOHVis and UpSet. In UpSet2D plots columns correspond to the vertices of the graph and rows correspond to the nodes. Filled-in cells represent nodes that belong to a hyper-edge.

**The package is a work-in-progress**. There are bugs, and example notebooks are missing. If you want to use this package, expect to make changes.

## Example

The following UpSet2D plot shows the [CogText task-construct hypergraph](https://github.com/morteza/cogtext). Rows are the nodes of the graph, i.e., cognitive tasks, and columns are the hyper-edges, i.e., cognitive constructs. Colors and annotations have been manually added to the figure.
